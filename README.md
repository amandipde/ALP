# ALP
## Search for ALP in the VBF channel at LHC
The UFO file includes the Lagrangian needed for the VBF process $pp \to ALP j j$. It contains the bosonic couplings i.e. ALP with ALP-Z-Z, ALP-W-W, ALP-Gamma-Gamma, ALP-Gamma-Z. The ALP-Gluon interactions are neglected, which translates to $C_\tilde{G} =0$.   

The contributions from ALP-fermion interactions are highly suppressed at the tree level, as their physical impact is always proportional to the mass of the fermion itself, and only light fermions appear in LO VBS diagrams. They are also neglected. The UFO file is the modified version of https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/ALPsEFT

VBF_* files are for automated production of VBF ALP process in Madgraph with W/Z and Gamma and combined processes.
